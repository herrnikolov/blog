					<description><![CDATA[Hi, and thank you for your kindness tp make a tutorial like this.
I have had som problems in the past, but now I now I am on the right track:)
The two pfsese can connect and send and recieve packets but ot transmit data to other network.
Can you provide a bit more help regarding the info about this?

Honestly speaking if I did not follow this guide, there was no routing between the two sites.
OpenVPN Site-to-Site PKI (SSL)

n the last post we’ve setup a Site To Site with Shared Key, now instead we will use internal Certificate Authority. Honestly speaking if I did not follow this guide, there was no routing between the two sites.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, i&#039;m using this tutorial to set a site-to-site VPN using pfsense and openvpn, the difference is my pfsenses are behind a firewall so they only works a vpn server ergo they shoudn&#039;t need a second interface, they just would need one interface each with a private ip address in the rance of my lans, am i right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I located the issue. The problem relys in the NAT. I&#039;m using manual nat an even though the client can access the server lan and ping correctly, the server cannot access the clients.

Still trying to figure it out.

Thenak for the help]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The rule for openvpn interface is allow all 
ID 	Proto 	Source 	Port 	Destination 	Port 	Gateway 	Queue 	Schedule 			* 	* 	* 	* 	* 	* 	none
The server replys to the ping, but a ping originated from within doens&#039;t go throught the tunnel. A traceroute show that it ends directly in pfsense internal IP. The pfsense is version 2.0 Final]]></description>
