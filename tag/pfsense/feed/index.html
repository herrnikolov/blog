<p>I’ve built my first pfSense router almost a decade ago. Fun fact is that the device is still working flawlessly, Alix2d13 is a beast. At that time 100 Mbps was more than enough compared to the offerings of the ISPs. Fast forward ten years, my WAN links are above this speed. CPU and RAM combined with the embedded architecture impose heavy limitations on the plugin options.<br><br>Still remember the time when equipped with console cable hooked to the  Alix running pfSense v 1.2.2. Holding tight to my hard copy of <em>pfSense  The Definitive Guide to the Open Source Firewall and Router Distribution</em>  Book. I’ve typed on the terminal. These days are long gone. <br><br>Currently running on a Dual Core Intel CPU with 8 GB RAM and SSD, pfSense is v 2.4.4. The book is freely available online.  It makes very little sense to me writing tutorials on how to do this and that any more. The only exception are some obscure cases that are  rare and sharing them will be mutually beneficial. <br><br>In retrospective PfSense has gone a long way for the past 9 years. The  project changed hands and lost some of its founding father. These changes steered the project in a direction that is not so much to my  liking.  To get a taste please review the following quotes: <br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="pfSense 2.5 and AES-NI (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-5-and-aes-ni.html" target="_blank">pfSense 2.5 and AES-NI</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>pfSense version 2.5 will be based on FreeBSD 12, which should bring route-based IPsec, along with support for our integrated management platform, NRDM (more about this soon), and a number of other features.</p><p>With the increasing ubiquity of computing devices permeating all areas of our lives at work and at home, the need for encryption has become more important than ever. Desktops, laptops, smart phones, tablets, and many other devices all share this need to be able to encrypt sensitive information. Without encryption, everything you send over a network (or even store on a local storage device) is in the open, for anyone to read anytime he wants to read or even change it.</p><p>While we’re not revealing the extent of our plans, we do want to give early notice that, in order to support the increased cryptographic loads that we see as part of pfSense version 2.5, pfSense Community Edition version 2.5 will include a requirement that the CPU supports AES-NI. On ARM-based systems, the additional load from AES operations will be offloaded to on-die cryptographic accelerators, such as the one found on our SG-1000. ARM v8 CPUs include instructions like AES-NI that can be used to increase performance of the AES algorithm on these platforms.<br></p><p>The AES-NI instruction set extensions are used to optimize encryption and decryption algorithms on select Intel and AMD processors. Intel announced AES-NI in 2008 and released supported CPUs late 2010 with the Westmere architecture. AMD announced and shipped AES-NI support in 2010, starting with Bulldozer.</p><p>Please remember these requirements when you are considering components for your pfSense system.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.netgate.com/blog/more-on-aes-ni.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="More on AES-NI (opens in a new tab)">More on AES-NI</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There have been some concerns expressed about the requirement for AES-NI (or other offload) with pfSense 2.5, as announced two days ago.</p><p>Some complained that, since they don’t use VPN, they don’t need AES-NI. While I wasn’t quite ready to say more about the “3.0” effort, it is the reason for the new requirement for pfSense 2.5 and beyond.</p><p>With AES you either design, test, and verify a bitslice software implementation, (giving up a lot of performance in the process), leverage hardware offloads, or leave the resulting system open to several known attacks. We have selected the “leverage hardware offloads” path. The other two options are either unthinkable, or involve a lot of effort for diminishing returns.</p><p>So why the requirement?</p><p>Future versions of pfSense have a new management model. We’re leveraging YANG, via RESTCONF.</p><p>The webGUI will be present either on our cloud service or on-device, both talking to the ‘back-end’ (written in ‘C’) on the device via a RESTCONF interface. This is just as I said back in February 2015.</p><p>We’re leveraging AES-GCM inside TLS as the transport layer, because RFC 7525 REQUIRES it, and the RESTCONF standard, RFC 8040, says RFC 7525 is a SHOULD.</p><p>AES-GCM in particular has problems with side-channel attacks on pure software implementations. ChaCha20, which nicely avoids these issues when in software, isn’t an option. This is because: a) it’s not RFC-compliant, and b) there are currently no acceleration offloads for it, and the situation is that there could be thousands, or tens of thousands of pfSense instances hitting a single (clustered) instance of our cloud management platform.</p><p>So the choice is either to design, engineer and release a less-than-strong product, or require AES-NI or other offloads.</p><p>The entire PHP layer is being eliminated in the “3.0” effort, and we’re simply too small to continue to maintain both the current, organically-grown PHP layer (100K lines of PHP in 200 files) and the new, pure JS GUI (client) architected as a single page web application.</p><p>So there is an excellent chance that pfSense 2.5 will use the new webGUI, talking to our RESTCONF back-end.</p><p>As should be obvious by now, this isn’t about VPN.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you’ve been testing 2.4 snapshots and updates, you’ve already seen a lot of new features. You have probably also seen a new pop-up in the webGUI.</p><p>Trademark Policy pop-up<br>While the pop-up is new, the message isn’t.  On January 27, 2017 we posted a blog Announcing a new trademark policy  for pfSense. This pop-up is a simple reminder that ensures everyone sees  and acknowledges the trademark policy. </p></blockquote>

<p></p>



<p>After reading these articles and looking at my old faithful Alix. It is time to look for alternatives. One possibility is <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OPNsense (opens in a new tab)">OPNsense</a></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://opnsense.org/wp-content/themes/OPNsense/assets/img/250x50xopnsense.png.pagespeed.ic.T0VFZY72q3.webp" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>These two articles condense a long story, hope you find them informative:<br>I&#8217;ll share just a small quotes from them.  </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trickey.io/posts/opn-vs-pf/" target="_blank">OPN VS. PF</a><br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> OPNSense is a fork of PFSense, and PFSense is itself a fork of m0n0wall. </p></blockquote>



<p><br>The story gets even more interesting: <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Building a BSD home router (pt. 6): pfSense vs. OPNsens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eerielinux.wordpress.com/2017/06/25/building-a-bsd-home-router-pt-6-pfsense-vs-opnsense/" target="_blank">Building a BSD home router (pt. 6): pfSense vs. OPNsens</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <br>Once upon a time… in 2003 there was a new firewall OS called m0n0wall. Manuel Kasper had built it on a stripped down version of FreeBSD. There had been small firewalls before, but Kasper’s innovation was to put a Web GUI on top of it so that the firewall’s settings could be controlled from the browser! It did not take long and m0n0wall took the world by storm. However Kasper’s project focused on embedded hardware. So only a while later a fork was created which geared towards more powerful hardware. The fork’s name? You’ve guessed it: pfSense. In 2015 Manuel Kasper officially ended the m0n0wall project (because recent versions of FreeBSD had been grown too big to be easily usable for what he did with it in the past). And guess what he did: He gave <a href="https://opnsense.org/m0n0wall">his official blessing</a> and recommends to migrate to and support OPNsense! </p></blockquote>



<p>So if I want to go with pfSense I need to get a box with CPU supporting these AES-NI instructions. For this either get a branded box or build one on my own. Naturally I&#8217;ve chosen the latter.  </p>



<p>In selecting the box I have to thank to the great members of the community forum of pfSense. <br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Alternative to Qotom Q190G4 with AES-NI? (opens in a new tab)" href="https://forum.netgate.com/topic/115489/alternative-to-qotom-q190g4-with-aes-ni" target="_blank">Alternative to Qotom Q190G4 with AES-NI?</a></p>



<p>My choice of box is this quiet beast:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/QOTOM-4-LAN-Mini-PC-with-Core-i3-4005U-i5-5250U-processor-and-4-Gigabit-NIC/32812678037.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="QOTOM 4 LAN Mini PC with Core i3-4005U / i5-5250U processor and 4 Gigabit NIC, support AES-NI, Serial, Fanless Mini PC pfSense (opens in a new tab)">QOTOM 4 LAN Mini PC with Core i3-4005U / i5-5250U processor and 4 Gigabit NIC, support AES-NI, Serial, Fanless Mini PC pfSense</a></p>



<p>Product properties: i5-5250U, 8G RAM, 128G SSD + Q355G4 WIFI $ 350.42 </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1jItsKH2pK1RjSZFsq6yNlXXaV/QOTOM-Pfsense-Mini-PC-with-Core-i3-i5-i7-processor-and-4-Gigabit-NICs-support-AES.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The fan less design combined with the SSD makes the operation completely silent. It keeps a steady 50 C temperature, with average CPU usage of 1-4 % and consumes only 7 – 10 % of the memory.  My hopes are that this will serve me for at least the next 10 years. As it is x86 architecture my choice of  OS dramatically widens leaving the door open to experiments with whatever comes to my mind.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve been running pfSense in Dual WAN mode for more than a decade. Unfortunately, some sites lately are quite sensitive per user session originating from multiple public IP addresses. The best description of the problem is from the official pfSense documentation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Some websites store session information including the client IP address, and if a subsequent connection to that site is routed out a different WAN interface using a different public IP address, the website will not function properly. This is becoming more common with banks and other security-minded sites. The suggested means of working around this is to create a failover group and direct traffic destined to these sites to the failover group rather than a load balancing group. Alternately, perform failover for all HTTPS traffic.</p><p>The sticky connections feature of pf is intended to resolve this problem, but it has historically been problematic. It is safe to use, and should alleviate this, but there is also a downside to using the sticky option. When using sticky connections, an association is held between the client IP address and a given gateway, it is not based off of the destination. When the sticky connections option is enabled, any given client would not load balance its connections between multiple WANs, but it would be associated with whichever gateway it happened to use for its first connection. Once all of the client states have expired, the client may exit a different WAN for its next connection, resulting in a new gateway pairing.</p></blockquote>



<p style="text-align:right"><a href="https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/book/multiwan/load-balancing-and-failover.html#problems-with-load-balancing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Problems with Load Balancing (opens in a new tab)">Problems with Load Balancing</a></p>



<p><br>After some testing and consideration let’s leave the sticky connections unchecked. As mentioned above they are problematic. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections-1024x206.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1248" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections-1024x206.png 1024w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections-300x60.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections-768x154.png 768w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GUI_Use_sticky_connections.png 1146w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>

<p>Other description of the problem here: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Some websites do not work properly if requests from the LAN are initiated from multiple public IP addresses. Hence load balancing is incompatible with these sites. Common examples are sites that maintain login sessions, most frequently online banking. This is most commonly observed with HTTPS sites so usually HTTPS should not be load balanced. Occasionally it is a problem with HTTP sites that maintain session, but this is rare. </p><p>For sites that do not function with load balancing, add firewall rules to not load balance traffic to these destinations or protocols. </p></blockquote>

<p><br>To alleviate this issue, you can do the following:<br><br>Here are my two Gateways</p>

<p>Add new rule that will be valid only for HTTPS connection and set the Gateway to the Fail-over Gateway Group. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1-967x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1273" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1-967x1024.png 967w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1-283x300.png 283w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1-768x814.png 768w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rules_LAN_FOWAN_HTTPS-1.png 1147w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></a></figure>



<p>This way all HTTPS
connections will pass through the First WAN until it goes down and failover to the
Second. 

The alternative is to make
separate rule for each and every HTTPS site with issues. The rule will be very
similar to the one for HTTPS. The difference will be that Destination address will
be single Public IP. Doing so will load balance all other HTTPS connection that
don’t have this problem.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server</p>
<p>Routing your entire internet traffic over VPN when away from home is almost a must. Especially when using public WiFi hotspots or hotel internet.</p>
<p>Hello all, long time no see. I have a lot of other engagements lately and can’t reach to our beloved topic of pfSense. The fact that I don’t write new posts does not mean that I have abandoned it. Sometimes you have to put priorities to things in your life that are not as pleasant as other, but are just as much if not more important.</p>
<p>Enough said about that. Let’s get to the topic.</p>
<p>Recently I was visiting Asian country. As you probably know there are some places that some sites are restricted for access. It was a strange experience to not be able to open pages that you usually use every day. On other hand I would prefer to route all traffic over my Internet connection back at home when in a foreign country. Just as a protection.</p>
<p>So for test purposes I’ve setup an OpenVPN instance to check if I’m able to route all my traffic back home.</p>
<p>During my research I’ve came across very interesting article on the pfSense documentation. The article is: “<a href="https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Sharing_a_Port_with_OpenVPN_and_a_Web_Server" target="_blank">Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server</a>”</p>
<p>It works and the only modification that has to be made to the OpenVPN server configuration are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the protocol to TCP in the General Information section<a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1027"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1027" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 01" width="773" height="131" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png 773w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01-300x51.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01-768x130.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></a></li>
<li>Don’t forget to tick in the Tunnel Settings &gt; Redirect Gateway</li>
</ol>
<p>(Force all client generated traffic through the tunnel.)</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1029"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1029" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 03" width="825" height="49" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png 825w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03-300x18.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03-768x46.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In Advanced configuration section in Advanced field put the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>port-share localhost 443<a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1026"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 02" width="761" height="163" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png 761w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></a></p>
<p>The old OpenVPN configuration instructions you can find here:</p>
<h2 class="post-title"><a title="Permanent Link to pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication" href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/pfsense-2-0-rc1-configuration-of-openvpn-server-for-rad-warrior-with-tls-and-user-authentication/" rel="bookmark permalink">pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Now you can connect to your pfSense / OpenVPN server on HTTPS and hopefully it would appear much like you are opening a page over SSL.</p>
<p>Have fun and as usual I don’t take any kind of responsibly for the way you use this setup, or any legal actions or consequences for that matter or related to it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>If you are in a café or another place with free wireless Internet access you are under a security risk. Your traffic can be monitored, captured and analysed. Your sensitive data can be stolen or your laptop infected with malicious application.</p>
<p>To avoid as much as possible of the above we can route all your traffic through the internet connection at home or in your office.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p>As a base configuration you can use <a href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/?p=492" target="_blank">pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication</a></p>
<p>up until the Tunnel Settings section of the OpenVPN Configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-957" title="Using your OpenVPN Road Warrior setup as a Secure Relay for the users - 01" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-01.png" alt="" width="909" height="678" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-01.png 909w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-01-300x223.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-01-200x150.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></a></p>
<p>There tick the Redirect Gateway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Client Settings enter DNS Server 1 as the IP address of you LAN interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-958" title="Using your OpenVPN Road Warrior setup as a Secure Relay for the users - 02" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-02.png" alt="" width="909" height="678" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-02.png 909w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-02-300x223.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Using-your-OpenVPN-Road-Warrior-setup-as-a-Secure-Relay-for-the-users-02-200x150.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>By doing so you will redirect all your traffic through the VPN connection and avoid the risks related to the publicly available Internet access hotspots. The addition of DNS server address is needed in order to use you own device to resolve web sites IPs instead of the publicly available DNS server of the hotspot.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>As a test you can trace route (tracert bbc.co.uk for example) a popular internet site with or without established VPN Connection.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At the cost of building just another VPN Server on your device you are gaining a little peace of mind while surfing the net from insecure location.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>After having &nbsp;enough of tests with the RC3 in virtual environment, I decide to upgrade my pfSense 1.2.3 appliance running on Alix2d13. Considering my Dual WAN setup with load balancing and some other rules, I didn’t really want to lose any of my configurations during this process.</p>
<p>If I made in-place upgrade what is my rollback strategy?!</p>
<p>If I performed clean install and just restored configuration backup what are the guaranties that is will work. Of course I can test it in my virtual lab, but there are risks with the physical scenario that I can’t predict using this method. So I needed and alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>I want to test upgrade my pfSense 1.2.3 to 2.0 RC3. For that purpose I need a reliable rollback plan with no data loss, and minimal operations required. How did I achieve it you can find in the Explanation section.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p>The setup is described in this post: <a href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/?p=306" target="_blank">SoHo Firewall Appliance with Alix2d13 and pfSense</a></p>
<p>,noting change there since.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p>First I made a backup of the full configuration of the 1.2.3, you know just in case.</p>
<pre>Then download the image file: <a href="http://mirror.qubenet.net/mirror/pfsense/updates/pfSense-2.0-RC3-4g-i386-20110621-1821-nanobsd-upgrade.img.gz">pfSense-2.0-RC3-4g-i386-20110621-1821-nanobsd-upgrade.img.gz</a></pre>
<p>And extract the image from the archive.</p>
<p>Now as it is described here: <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/installation_generic.php" target="_blank">Installation on a standard PC (CF/IDE version)</a></p>
<p>We need the <strong>physdiskwrite</strong> tool to write the image to the Compact Flash (CF). I’ve used the</p>
<p><a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/physdiskwrite.php" target="_blank">physdiskwrite 0.5.2 + PhysGUI</a></p>
<p>Then I plug in the new CF in the card reader make sure there are no portions on it using the Disk Management Console (Start &gt; Run&gt; diskmgmt.msc), otherwise you will receive error message like the one in the Issue section below.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CF.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931" title="CF" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CF.png" alt="" width="674" height="102" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CF.png 674w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CF-300x45.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></a><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PhysGUI.png"></a></p>
<p>Then start physdiskwrite with PhysGUI, select the CF disk.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PhysGUI.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936" title="PhysGUI" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PhysGUI.png" alt="" width="723" height="295" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PhysGUI.png 723w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PhysGUI-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>

<p>We are ready.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Done.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932" title="Done" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Done.png" alt="" width="244" height="171"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Finally I get it, instead of changing the content of my original Compact Flash, why not get second one and use is for the tests instead? This way I can retain my original configuration and with just a swap of the cards be right back where I started.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>After successful installation I’ve just swap the CFs and configured pfSense 2.0 RC3 using console cable.</p>
<p>Then using the WebGUI restored the backup configuration from the 1.2.3. Now it is time to check the functionality.</p>
<p>The Interface configuration like interfaced configuration was in place but the Load Balancing configuration was gone. Also my OpenVPN configurations were restored but in a non-working state. The firewall rules were applied but with the missing Load Balancer there was little use of them. After about half hour of checks, I decided to roll back to 1.2.3. Swap the CFs again and everything works the old way.</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p>Writing to the CF card, As stated in <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/physdiskwrite.php" target="_blank">Special considerations for Windows Vista/7</a></p>
<blockquote><p>If you get write errors shortly after physdiskwrite has begun writing to the target disk (usually after 65536 bytes), this may be caused by existing partitions on the disk. Use the Disk Management utility (right-click on the &#8220;Computer&#8221; icon on the desktop and select Manage, then navigate to Computer Management (Local)/Storage) to delete all partitions on the target disk before starting physdiskwrite.</p>
<p>If you are unable to delete all the partitions with the Disk Management utility, try the following procedure:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a command window as admin (&#8220;cmd&#8221;)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &#8220;diskpart&#8221; and hit enter.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &#8220;list disk&#8221; and hit enter to find out the number of your drive.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &#8220;select disk X&#8221; (where you replace X with the number of your drive) and hit enter.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &#8220;clean&#8221; and hit enter.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I had to clean the disk first but it was a breezy task. Then everything was alright.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Up until the restoration of the configuration backup everything is ok. Now I have to test the restoration in my lab, or better yet reproduce my original configuration there. I ought to think for the second alternative more.</p>
<p>To configure everything in the lab and then just backup and restore the configuration from the same one and the same version sound reasonable to me. Better yet I will know that it works.</p>
<p>I’ll have to test Dual WAN in fail-over configuration, then test recreate my OpenVPN configurations, and test all the rules that I have applied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>After writing OpenVPN with LDAP authentication on pfSense 2.0 RC1, a reader of my blog shared some problems with configuring OpenLDAP on CentOS.&nbsp; So I decide to build such a setup and test.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>The scenario is as follows, authenticating users requiring access to the OpenVPN server against OpenLDAP service running on CentOS.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p>I’ve spent most time in preparing the CentOS server. Initially my decision was to use CentOS 6.0, but after a few failed attempts to configure it and the absence of how to guides for this purpose, I’ve decided to fall back to 5.6.</p>
<p>For this version there is a wonderful how to guide here:</p>
<p><a href="http://drozd.com/2011/04/22/openldap-on-centos-5-6/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP on CentOS 5.6</a></p>
<p><a href="http://drozd.com/2011/04/22/openldap-on-centos-5-6/" target="_blank">Install And Configure OpenLDAP 2.4.25 On CentOS 5.6</a></p>
<p>Following this instructions I’ve managed to setup OpenLDAP very fast.&nbsp; The only comment that I have is in this section:</p>
<blockquote><p>All data loaded is in&nbsp;<a title="LDAP Data Interchange Format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format" target="_blank">LDIF</a> format. Create a file to initialize the LDAP database:</p>
<p># vi ldap-init.ldif</p>
<p>dn: dc=mycompany,dc=com</p>
<p>objectclass: dcObject</p>
<p>objectclass: organization</p>
<p>o: Example</p>
<p>dc: mycompany</p>
<p>dn: cn=Admin,dc=mycompany,dc=com</p>
<p>objectclass: organizationalRole</p>
<p>cn: Admin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>you have to have one new row, otherwise the import in the next step fails. So the above should look like:</p>
<blockquote><p># vi ldap-init.ldif</p>
<p>dn: dc=mycompany,dc=com</p>
<p>objectclass: dcObject</p>
<p>objectclass: organization</p>
<p>o: Example</p>
<p>dc: mycompany</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>dn: cn=Admin,dc=mycompany,dc=com</p>
<p>objectclass: organizationalRole</p>
<p>cn: Admin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next step is to create a few test users. &nbsp;For that purpose I’ve used :</p>
<p><a href="http://ldapadmin.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">LDAP Admin</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Ldap Admin is free Win32 administration tool for LDAP directory management. This application lets you browse, search, modify, create and delete objects on LDAP server. It also supports more complex operations such as directory copy and move between remote servers and extends the common edit functions to support specific object types (such as groups and accounts).</p>
<p>You can use it to manage Posix groups and accounts, Samba accounts and it even includes support for Postfix MTA. Ldap Admin is free Open Source software distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p>It is time to configure the pfSense. I will skip all the steps described in the previous posts. You can find them here:</p>
<p><a href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/?p=492" target="_blank">pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication</a></p>
<p><a href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/?p=528" target="_blank">OpenVPN with LDAP authentication on pfSense 2.0 RC1</a></p>
<p>Now let’s get straight to System &gt; User Manager and on the Servers leaf.</p>
<p><strong>Hostname or IP address:</strong> this it the address of the CentOS server</p>
<p><strong>Base DN</strong>: this is the domain name</p>
<p><strong>Authentication container</strong>: after insterted the Bind credentials, it was visible, but when I&#8217;ve click on the Save button, nothing happen. So I&#8217;ve typed it in manually.</p>
<p><strong>Bind Credentials</strong>: enter User DN and Password. , I&#8217;ve tested it and with <strong>Use anonymous binds to resolve distinguished names</strong>, it works also.</p>
<p><strong>Group Member Attribute</strong>: you can modify this with the Uid=%s, if you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Authenticaton-Config.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917" title="Authenticaton Config" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Authenticaton-Config.png" alt="" width="888" height="732" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Authenticaton-Config.png 888w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Authenticaton-Config-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>Just for reference this is my test user.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LDAP-Admin.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918" title="LDAP Admin" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LDAP-Admin.png" alt="" width="742" height="409" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LDAP-Admin.png 742w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LDAP-Admin-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></a></p>
<p>After preforming the OpenVPN configuration, enter the user name and the password.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-Login.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" title="OpenVPN Login" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-Login.png" alt="" width="577" height="372" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-Login.png 577w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-Login-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></a></p>
<p>If everything is OK, you should be successfully connected and see something similar in the OpenVPN logs:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-server-Log.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" title="OpenVPN server Log" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-server-Log.png" alt="" width="805" height="423" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-server-Log.png 805w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OpenVPN-server-Log-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /></a></p>
<p>You can also test the connection using the Diagnostics &gt; Authentication, Select the Authentication Server, in my case the CentOS OpenLDAP connection is named Test. Enter Username and Password, and see the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authentication.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-943" title="Test Authentication" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authentication.png" alt="" width="881" height="342" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authentication.png 881w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authentication-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px" /></a></p>
<p>If you get error, you can check the Status&gt; System Logs on the System leaf for errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-Msg.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944" title="Test Authenticaion Error Msg" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-Msg.png" alt="" width="886" height="387" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-Msg.png 886w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-Msg-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got this error when the CentOS server was turn off.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-System-Logs.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945" title="Test Authenticaion Error System Logs" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-System-Logs.png" alt="" width="887" height="262" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-System-Logs.png 887w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Test-Authenticaion-Error-System-Logs-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p>The issues that I faced was the problem with selecting the OU in which my users resides. Hope this will be fixed in future versions<strong>. </strong>On the CentOS side the problems were releted with the changes of OpenLDAP in the 6.0 version.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>That’s it. Thank you for reading.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days I’ve looked at the tweets of <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sullrich" target="_blank">Scott Ullrich</a> and what catch my attention is the mentioning of pfCenter several times.</p>
<p>As written here:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sullrich/status/75712042077655040" target="_blank">pfCenter is the product we are working on to allow administration of multiple pfSense boxen from one GUI / Appliance.</a></p>
<p>and here</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sullrich/status/75341743582752768" target="_blank">pfCenter now supports tags! Later this summer we will change how large scale deployments of pfSense are managed.</a></p>
<p>After I have took a look at the shred screen shots from <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/sullrich" target="_blank">his image gallery</a>.</p>
<p>There is even a thread in the forum with obscure information: <a href="http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=39308.0" target="_blank">Next Gen of pfSense &lt;&#8212;&gt; pfCenter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suspicion is that this center will perform tasks similar to <a href="http://www.astaro.com/solutions/central-management" target="_blank">Astaro Command Center.</a></p>
<p>There will be a Real-Time Monitoring, Site-to-Site VPN configuration for multiple sites made quick and easy. We can hope for centralisation of Device Maintenance tasks such as firmware upgrades and configurations propagation, some kind of Inventory Management component that can show us what, where and in what state we have. Access Management so you must know only one set of credentials to manage all hooked up devices. I really do hope that there will be some form of Aggregated Reporting functionality, RRD is great for some purposes, but alone is not enough and NTOP is great but a dedicated appliance is better suited for it alone.</p>
<p>The next logical question is where you would you place such thing?</p>
<p>On a pfSense box, might be, but a dedicate Appliance sounds more reasonable, taking into account the amount of data and load, that such a solution could generate. As alternative a Virtual Appliance sounds as a good idea. Last but not least as an option is a service in the cloud, a hosted multi-tenant installation of the pfCenter. Which of these alternatives will be the one we’ll see?</p>
<p>Until then, take a look at the teasers:</p>
