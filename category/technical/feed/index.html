								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Hello everyone. I’ve been running this blog for 9 years now. In 2010 there were very few options to host WordPress site. The blog was hosted in one local provider up until its acquisition by another company two years ago. This pushed me to move. At that time, I was experimenting with Azure and the natural choice of service was an Azure Web App with WordPress template. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WordPress-on-Linux-on-Azure.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1177"/><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The platform is packed with settings that you can tweak. Unfortunately, the prices are targeted at enterprise customers and were too steep for a small site like mine. <br>Recently a friend of mine mentioned the Static Site Generators. I’ve investigated the topic and it appeared quite an interesting concept. For my purposes this solution fits well as most of my content is static. Thanks to GDPR I had to close all comments and feedback options, which made the site even more static. On the positive side not having to worry about PHP and MySQL out in the wild sounds very a pleasing. </p>



<p><strong>Static Site Generators Research</strong><br>After reviewing a couple of solutions, the idea to use WordPress as a Static Site Generators begin to take shape. This could be achieved by employing Plugins. The ones that I’m currently experimenting with are: <br> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Simply Static (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/" target="_blank">Simply Static</a><br> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WP2Static (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank">WP2Static</a><br> Each has some very strong features. But I still haven’t decided which one to keep. <br> Simply Static has great Diagnostics that helped me troubleshoot some issues. Offering streamlined interface with essential options. While WP2Static gives more control over the crawling and processing with valuable options to clean up some garbage from the output pages. <br> They both produced archives containing the static content, WP2Static can even be configured to push it directly to GitHub repository. </p>



<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong><br>Either way I have a static version of my site now. The next hurdle is where to store the files? <br>I don’t want to host it On-Premise as this will require a lot of additional time and effort. As the Cloud options are so many, let’s narrow it down to Static Websites on Azure Storage and GitHub for simplicity sake. <br>Ever since I’ve read about the Static Websites in Azure, I really wanted to try it with something. Now having the content experiments can commence. My inspiration came from this article <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Static websites on Azure Storage now generally available (opens in a new tab)" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/static-websites-on-azure-storage-now-generally-available/" target="_blank">Static websites on Azure Storage now generally available</a><br> Price for storing content and data transfers charges would be low in my case. SSL is requirement but it is not directly offered from Static Websites. I need Azure CDN in front to get the desired feature. This will incur additional cost and complexity for just one simple static site served over HTTPs.  <br>For Web Apps there is a Azure Let’s Encrypt Extension that is a pretty useful solution to automatically renew the SSL Certificate.  <br> <br>This tilted the table in favour of GitHub. There are no taxes for storing publicly accessible content and it automatically takes care of the SSL Certificate provisioning and renewal. For the moment GitHub wins.    <br></p>



<p><strong>WordPress Hosting</strong><br> Now that I have the generation and web hosting covered. The last obstacle is where to keep my Static Content Generating WordPress instance? <br><br><em> Cloud:</em><br> <em>WordPress.com</em> – good starting point. But pretty much the same. You get a free WordPress instance somewhere out there. Not my ideal solution. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/aci_logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1224" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/aci_logo.png 230w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/aci_logo-150x150.png 150w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/aci_logo-144x144.png 144w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></figure></div>



<p> <em>Azure Containers Instance</em> – recently I have experiment with this service. It is perfectly suited to quickly get up and running a bunch of containers. Get the job done and destroy them. There is a ready-made template to build two containers solution for WordPress here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Create a WordPress site on a Container Instance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-aci-wordpress" target="_blank">Create a WordPress site on a Container Instance</a><br>My experience with the service is mostly positive. Bringing it up is easy. Getting data persistence requires modifying the template. The performance at the lowest tire was comparable to the once in Web App and insufficient from my perspective. <br> <br><em>Local:</em><br> VM with docker containers – My first choice. Spun up Ubuntu server, quickly and easily installed docker and docker compose. As I felt generous at the time the VM had 4 CPU cores and 4 GB or RAM. Even on mechanical HDD, performance was Fantastic! I never knew that WordPress could feel so snappy! The downside is that I will not keep the VM running all the time and must start and stop it every time that I want to do something.  <br> </p>

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> RPI with docker containers &#8211; As I have a Raspberry Pi humming in the background. This is a preferable alternative to a full blown VM.  I’ve managed to install docker and docker compose relatively easy using as a starting point this article: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The easy way to set up Docker on a Raspberry Pi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-easy-way-to-set-up-docker-on-a-raspberry-pi-7d24ced073ef" target="_blank">The easy way to set up Docker on a Raspberry Pi </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="HOW TO RUN DOCKER AND DOCKER-COMPOSE ON RASPBIAN (opens in a new tab)" href="https://manre-universe.net/how-to-run-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspbian/" target="_blank">HOW TO RUN DOCKER AND DOCKER-COMPOSE ON RASPBIAN</a><br> <br>To my unpleasant surprise there is NO official MySQL image for ARM,  Really!? Check this article: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=86501%20https://scito.ch/content/mysql-57-docker-container-raspberry-pi-using-debian-sid" target="_blank">Install mysql server-5.7 on ARMv8 architecture (raspberry pi 3 model B)</a><br>But there is one for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. I’ve tried building one on my own and hit a lot of problems! As a temporary solution for the moment I’m using this image  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/hypriot/rpi-mysql/" target="_blank">hypriot/rpi-mysql</a>. Works fine but holds MySQL 5.5 and my aim is 5.7. In near future I’ll look into it and if possible, build one image on my own.   <br>  Had a few hiccups with the persistent storage of data for both WordPress and MySQL containers, but got it right at the end.  <br>Here is the content of my docker-compose file:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>version: '3.7'

services:
   db:
     image: hypriot/rpi-mysql:latest
     volumes:
       - ./db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: [ROOTPASSWORD]
       MYSQL_DATABASE: [DBNAME]
       MYSQL_USER: [DBUSER]
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: [DBPASSWORD]

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:latest
     volumes:
      - ./wp-content:/var/www/html:rw
     ports:
       - "80:80"
     restart: always
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: [DBNAME]
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: [DBUSER]
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: [DBPASSWORD]

volumes:
    db_data: {}
    wp-content: {}</code></pre>



<p> Again, the performance is even more surprisingly good compared the cloud scenarios. Considering that it is run off a mechanical hard drive on a very humble 1.2GHz Quad and only 1 GB of RAM.  </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>With this exercise I’ve managed to decrease the costs of hosting this blog to the bare minimum. Hosting costs are reduced to virtually free. The power costs for the Raspberry Pi are shared with other services and are negligible. <br> Compared with Azure Web App and it’s 20 Euros per month it is a feat! <br> My initial intention for this post was to be short and sweet, but it grew into something much larger. I was able to compress a few weeks of research and experiments into these few lines omitting a lot of problems crossed along the way. Hope you enjoy reading it. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are on Windows 10, you should probably give a try to Windows Subsystem for Linux. Getting a bash shell under Windows was not a trivial task back in the day.</p>
<p>Now you just head to the Microsoft Store and install one. There are variety of distributions to choose from ranging Debian, Ubuntu, Open SUSE and even Kali.</p>
<p>My preference is Ubuntu but wait there are 3 of them! This is quite confusing isn’t it?</p>
<p>Well I’ve finally found a reasonable explanation in this article: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/fyi/there-are-now-three-versions-of-ubuntu-in-the-microsoft-store-heres-why/">There Are Now Three Versions of Ubuntu in the Microsoft Store, Here’s Why</a></p>
<p>So if you need the latest and greatest LTS version simply install Ubuntu. For the moment my choice lays with Ubuntu 16.04 because of some application compatibility that is missing in 18.04 with <a href="https://github.com/vuori/weasel-pageant">weasel-pageant.</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server</p>
<p>Routing your entire internet traffic over VPN when away from home is almost a must. Especially when using public WiFi hotspots or hotel internet.</p>
<p>Hello all, long time no see. I have a lot of other engagements lately and can’t reach to our beloved topic of pfSense. The fact that I don’t write new posts does not mean that I have abandoned it. Sometimes you have to put priorities to things in your life that are not as pleasant as other, but are just as much if not more important.</p>
<p>Enough said about that. Let’s get to the topic.</p>
<p>Recently I was visiting Asian country. As you probably know there are some places that some sites are restricted for access. It was a strange experience to not be able to open pages that you usually use every day. On other hand I would prefer to route all traffic over my Internet connection back at home when in a foreign country. Just as a protection.</p>
<p>So for test purposes I’ve setup an OpenVPN instance to check if I’m able to route all my traffic back home.</p>
<p>During my research I’ve came across very interesting article on the pfSense documentation. The article is: “<a href="https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Sharing_a_Port_with_OpenVPN_and_a_Web_Server" target="_blank">Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server</a>”</p>
<p>It works and the only modification that has to be made to the OpenVPN server configuration are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the protocol to TCP in the General Information section<a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1027"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1027" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 01" width="773" height="131" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01.png 773w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01-300x51.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-01-768x130.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></a></li>
<li>Don’t forget to tick in the Tunnel Settings &gt; Redirect Gateway</li>
</ol>
<p>(Force all client generated traffic through the tunnel.)</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1029"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1029" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 03" width="825" height="49" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03.png 825w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03-300x18.png 300w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-03-768x46.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In Advanced configuration section in Advanced field put the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>port-share localhost 443<a href="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1026"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png" alt="Sharing a Port with OpenVPN and a Web Server 02" width="761" height="163" srcset="https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02.png 761w, https://blog.stefcho.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sharing-a-Port-with-OpenVPN-and-a-Web-Server-02-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></a></p>
<p>The old OpenVPN configuration instructions you can find here:</p>
<h2 class="post-title"><a title="Permanent Link to pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication" href="http://stefcho.azurewebsites.net/pfsense-2-0-rc1-configuration-of-openvpn-server-for-rad-warrior-with-tls-and-user-authentication/" rel="bookmark permalink">pfSense 2.0 RC1 configuration of OpenVPN Server for Road Warrior with TLS and User Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Now you can connect to your pfSense / OpenVPN server on HTTPS and hopefully it would appear much like you are opening a page over SSL.</p>
<p>Have fun and as usual I don’t take any kind of responsibly for the way you use this setup, or any legal actions or consequences for that matter or related to it.</p>
